# AI Agents Overview

This document defines the roles and responsibilities of AI agents working within the Grove workspace.

## Core Directives

1. **Verify via Build**: Always run a full production build (`npx next build` or equivalent) after completing a task to catch syntax errors, type mismatches, or layout breakage that unit tests might miss.
2. **Test-First Triage**: Follow BDD-style triage. Reproduce bugs in failing tests before fixing.
3. **Keep Nora Thin**: Avoid bloating `apps/nora`. Place major capabilities in sibling apps and keep Nora as a thin consumer.
4. **Permanent Logs**: Maintain an audit log for non-deterministic bugs (gitignored).

## Workspace Standards

- **Linkification**: When mentioning files in chat, always use markdown links: `[path/to/file.ts](path/to/file.ts)`.
- **Documentation**: Update `DESIGN.md` and `README.md` immediately after any structural or capability change.
